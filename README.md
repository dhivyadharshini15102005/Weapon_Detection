## 🧠 Overview

This project is designed to detect **weapons (guns, knives, etc.)** in real-time using a webcam or surveillance feed. It helps in enhancing public safety in high-risk areas like:

- Airports ✈️  
- Schools 🏫  
- Banks 🏦  
- Malls 🏬  
- Events & Concerts 🎤

Using **YOLOv8** from the Ultralytics library, it processes video streams with high-speed and accuracy, triggering alerts when weapons are detected.
